This project is made with [Flutter Framework](https://www.flutter.dev), [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/), [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) and [Adobe XD Flutter plugin](https://xd.adobelanding.com/xd-to-flutter/).

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Installation and Config
- Install [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) from official site.
- Setup Environment for [Android](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs) and [iOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/ios-devs)

` 
## Build Project
- To run and build project run command `flutter build <device-name>`
- To get devices list, run `flutter devices`

## Learning
Few things I have used that you can work to understand flutter development.
- Cross Platform app using Flutter
- Responsive UI

You can build your own project on this just by changing dart code in `lib` folder.
